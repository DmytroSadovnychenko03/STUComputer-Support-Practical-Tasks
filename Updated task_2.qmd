# Task 2. Subsetting data. Working with NA
## Question 1 

# Create the next random vector:
v <- rnorm(50)

# For the vector, print:

# 10th item
v[10]

# items from 10th to 20th (including 20th item)
v[10:20]

# 10 items starting from 5th
v[5:(5+9)]

# all items bigger than 0
v[v > 0]

# last 5 items
v[(length(v)-4):length(v)]

## Question 2

# Create the next data frame:
df <- data.frame(a = rnorm(50), 
                 b = 1:50, 
                 cc = sample(letters, 50, replace = TRUE))

# For the data frame, find and print:

# the last 10 rows
tail(df, 10)

# 15th item of column 'cc'
df$cc[15]

# subset columns 'a' and 'b' and rows from 10th to 20th (including 20th)
df[10:20, c("a", "b")]

# a new vector from column 'b'
new_vector_b <- df$b
new_vector_b

## Question 3 

# Create the next random vector:
v_na <- rnorm(30)
num_na <- sample(10, 1)
v_na[sample(30, num_na)] <- NA

# For this vector:

# print all not NA items
v_na[!is.na(v_na)]

# find how many NA values the vector has
sum(is.na(v_na))

# find min, max, and mean for the vector
min(v_na, na.rm = TRUE)
max(v_na, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(v_na, na.rm = TRUE)
